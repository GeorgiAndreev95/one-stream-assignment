# 1-Stream â€“ Front-end - TMDB API Task

How to run the frontend:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run **npm install** in the root folder
3. Create an .env file in the root folder and add the TMDB API key with the key name shown in the .env.sample file.
4. Run **npm run dev** in the terminal

**notes:**
* You can see the JSON movie list  data sent to the dummy backend in the browser dev console after you click the **Save** button.
* I focused on the functionality of the app rather then spending too much time on the CSS styling in order to submit the task as soon as possible.
